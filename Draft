Requirements:
Add Time off button

Minimum shifts
Maximum hours
Legal considerations
Time frame we have X amount of clerks
Save button, Save draft button
Tab with Saved drafts and names

Tech Stack:
Backend
Python
Flask
Frontend

React
Database
#Stores user data, schedules, and constraints.
SQLITE
PostgreSQL

Algorithm for Schedule Generation:
Linear programming
SciPy
Must handle changes dynamically as new requests come in

Development and Testing:
Minimal Viable Product (MVP) with core features
Test with actual user data to see how it preforms

Feedback and Iteration:
Once ready, have Gus and Victor use it and give feedback
Change design based on feedback

Deployment:
Deploy on a server ex. Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean
Linear programming can optimize scheduling by minimizing the total hours while meeting all constraints (employee availability, minimum shift length, max hours per week.
Set up the problem where each shift is a variable and constraints are based on the employeesâ€™ availability and legal requirements

Machine Learning and AI:
Predictive modeling: Historical data to predict demand or required staffing levels on given days or times. 
Time series analysis or regression models
AI Optimization: More complex AI techniques like genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning can be used to adjust schedules based on ongoing data input and changes.

Namecheap or godaddy

Security:
HTTPS(SSL/TLS)
